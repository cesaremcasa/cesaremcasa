# Hi, I'm Cesar — AI Systems Engineer

I build production-grade AI systems with a focus on:

• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
• Hybrid retrieval pipelines (BM25 + embeddings + FAISS)  
• Agentic workflows and tool orchestration  
• Python/FastAPI backends with structured logging and tracing  
• Clean subsystem design, modular architecture, and scalable patterns  

My work emphasizes clarity, grounded engineering, and reproducible pipelines.  
Not demos — real systems.

## Featured Project
🔷 **Winter Garden Legal RAG (MVP Architecture)**  
Portfolio-grade backend structured like a real RAG service:  
hybrid retrieval, ingest/parse pipelines, config system, observability, and API contract tests.

## Engineering Focus
• Python, FastAPI, pydantic  
• Retrieval, embeddings, FAISS  
• LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic)  
• Data pipelines, ingestion, chunking, indexing  
• Architecture-first system design
