## Engineering Focus

I architect and deploy AI systems with emphasis on:

**Agentic AI & LLM Systems:**
- Autonomous and multi-agent systems
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture
- LLM orchestration and tool calling
- Prompt engineering and transformer architectures
- LangChain agents, chains, and tool integration
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Vector search (Pinecone, AlloyDB Vector)

**Cloud Platforms & MLOps:**
- Google Cloud Platform: Compute Engine, Cloud Run, AlloyDB, BigQuery, Gemini Ecosystem
- Azure Machine Learning: Model deployment, endpoints, ML workflow operations
- Serverless pipelines and infrastructure automation
- VPC, IAM, and cloud security patterns

**Data & Analytics Engineering:**
- DuckDB analytics and BigQuery optimization
- ETL pipelines and data ingestion
- Structured and unstructured data processing
- REST APIs, OAuth, and webhook integrations
- MCP Toolbox for database orchestration

**Backend Development & Automation:**
- Python (production-grade), Node.js, TypeScript
- FastAPI and automation frameworks
- Backend integration and CI/CD pipelines
- Cron orchestration and scheduled workflows
- Structured logging and observability
