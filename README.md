Hi, I’m Cesar — AI Systems Engineer

I build production-grade AI systems with a focus on:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Hybrid retrieval pipelines (BM25 + embeddings + FAISS)

Agentic workflows and tool orchestration

Python/FastAPI backends with structured logging and tracing

Clean subsystem design, modular architecture, and scalable patterns

My work emphasizes clarity, grounded engineering, and reproducible pipelines.
Not demos — real systems.

🔹 Featured Project
Winter Garden Legal RAG (MVP Architecture)

Portfolio-grade backend structured like a real RAG service: hybrid retrieval, ingest/parse pipelines, config system, observability, and API contract tests.

👉 Repository:
https://github.com/cesaremcasa/winter-garden-legal-rag-mvp

🛠 Engineering Focus

Python, FastAPI, pydantic

Retrieval, embeddings, FAISS

Hybrid retrieval patterns (sparse + dense)

Modular pipelines (ingestion, parsing, indexing, retrieval)

Agentic systems and LLM orchestration

Structured logging, tracing, and reproducible builds

📌 Current Work (In Progress)
My Orlando – Experience

A full RAG-based tourism AI agent for Orlando:
multilingual retrieval, theme-park datasets (Disney, Universal, SeaWorld), local logistics intelligence, and contextual itinerary generation.

This is the next large-scale system in the same architectural lineage as the Winter Garden RAG — but with deeper multi-domain retrieval, multi-language support, and experience-driven agent workflows.
